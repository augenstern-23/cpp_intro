cpp intro course day 2


Tasks for the computer lab I
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to input a person's name and postal code.
Immediately after an entry is submitted the program should respond with or depending on the postal code entered1
After that it should ask the user something like ;
if y is entered it should repeat the last step;
if n is entered it should print the percentage of entered people that lives in Berlin and the name of the person with the smallest postal code; and then quit.

Tasks for the computer lab II a
Copy'n'paste some of the examples from the slides and check if they make sense to you!
What happens when you return something of const type from a function?
#
Can constants be initialised from functions that return a non-const type?
What happens when you return a reference? What about the example on slide 20?
What combinations of const, const &, & (and none) are there for variables and for function return values? Which combinations are valid/invalid for initialising the variable?
